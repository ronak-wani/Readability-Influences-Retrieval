'''Your task:

1. Read all three versions.
2. Choose ONE short English phrase (a few words, max about 12 words) that:
   - Refers to the main idea or central topic of the article.
   - Uses ONLY words (or simple inflected forms) that appear in ALL THREE versions.
   - Is fair and appropriate for all three reading levels.
   - Is specific enough to distinguish this article from other articles.
   - Does NOT mention the words "article", "text", or the reading level.
   - Does NOT include the question templates below, only the phrase to insert.

These are the question templates we will use (you DO NOT fill them, they are just examples):

Ele-Q: "In the article '{title}', what happens with {{phrase}}?"
Int-Q: "According to the article '{title}', what does it say about {{phrase}}?"
Adv-Q: "In the article '{title}', how does the author explain or present {{phrase}}?"

Generate Question for each template
